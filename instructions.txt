Online Bookstore Project Structure:
Objective:
Develop an online bookstore to display books, categories, details, and search functionalities using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with locally stored book data.
Task Guidelines:
HTML Structure (index.html):

Create an HTML file (index.html) providing the layout for the online bookstore.
Structure the header, book categories, book display section, search bar, and book details section.
CSS Styling (styles.css):

Implement CSS styles for the website layout, header, navigation bar, book cards, search bar, and book details for a visually appealing interface.
JavaScript Functionality (script.js):

Manage book data using JavaScript arrays or objects stored locally within the script file.
Populate the website with local book data and implement functionalities using this data.
Book Data Setup:

Create an array or object containing book details such as title, author, genre, ISBN, description, and image URLs.
Populate the local book data with a reasonable number of books to display.
Book Display:

Implement functions to display books categorized by genres or categories on the homepage.
Show book covers, titles, authors, and brief descriptions using the locally stored data.

Testing and Validation:

Thoroughly test the website functionalities, ensuring correct book data display, search functionality, and book details.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit all files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) in a compressed archive (ZIP format).
Label and organize code sections for clarity and understanding.
Ensure the website functions without errors and showcases the local book data accurately.
Note:
Utilize local JavaScript arrays or objects to simulate book data for this project.
Encourage students to focus on functionality and user interface design while using local data as a substitute for APIs or databases.
Emphasize the importance of proper code structure, comments, and adherence to coding best practices to create an engaging and functional online bookstore using only locally stored book information.
